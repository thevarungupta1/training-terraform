### What is IaC - Infrastructure as Code


It is a process of managing and provisioning the complete IT infrastructure (comprised of both physical and virtual machines) using machine-readable definition files.

It is a software engineering approach to operations.

It helps in automating the complete data center by using a programming script.



# Features of IaC
- automation
- multiple resources can be deployed
- cloud agnostic

# **Terraform Overview**

## **What is Terraform?**  
Terraform is an **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** tool developed by **HashiCorp**. It allows users to define, provision, and manage cloud infrastructure in a **declarative** manner using configuration files. Terraform can be used to manage infrastructure across multiple cloud providers, on-premises data centers, and third-party services.

It is an infrastructure provisioning tool where you can store your cloud infrastructure setup as code.

It is very similar to tools such as CloudFormation, which you would use to automate your AWS infrastructure, but you can use only that on AWS. You can use Terraform on other cloud platforms as well.

## **Terraform Core Concepts**
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Manages infrastructure using code instead of manual processes.
- **Declarative Configuration**: Users specify the desired state, and Terraform ensures it is achieved.
- **State Management**: Maintains a state file to track resource changes.
- **Execution Plans**: Uses `terraform plan` to preview changes before applying them.
- **Resource Graph**: Determines dependencies and execution order.
- **Providers and Modules**: Extensible through plugins to support various platforms.

## **Terraform Life Cycle**
1. **Write**: Define infrastructure using HCL.
2. **Init**: Initialize Terraform in the working directory.
3. **Plan**: Preview changes before applying them.
4. **Apply**: Execute changes to reach the desired state.
5. **Destroy**: Remove resources when they are no longer needed.

## **Main Features of Terraform**  

### 1. **Declarative Configuration**  
- Users define the desired state of their infrastructure in configuration files, and Terraform ensures that state is achieved.  
- Uses **HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL)** or JSON.

### 2. **Multi-Cloud Support**  
- Works with major cloud providers like **AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, and others**.  
- Supports on-premises solutions (e.g., VMware, OpenStack).  
- Can manage **third-party services** like databases, Kubernetes, and networking.

### 3. **State Management**  
- Keeps track of infrastructure using a **state file (`terraform.tfstate`)**.  
- Ensures changes are incremental and controlled.  
- Can be stored locally or remotely (e.g., AWS S3, Terraform Cloud).

### 4. **Modular and Reusable Code**  
- Supports **modules**, which are reusable infrastructure components.  
- Enables **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** principles.

### 5. **Execution Plan (`terraform plan`)**  
- Shows a preview of the changes before applying them.  
- Helps avoid unintended modifications.

### 6. **Automation and CI/CD Integration**  
- Works with **GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD**, and other DevOps tools.  
- Enables **automated infrastructure deployments**.

### 7. **Provisioning and Orchestration**  
- Automates the creation, updating, and deletion of resources.  
- Can interact with configuration management tools like **Ansible, Chef, Puppet**.

### 8. **Resource Graphing**  
- Uses a dependency graph to determine the optimal order of resource creation.  
- Ensures efficient provisioning.

### 9. **Immutable Infrastructure**  
- Promotes **rebuilding infrastructure** rather than modifying it in place.  
- Reduces configuration drift and improves consistency.

### 10. **Extensible via Providers**  
- Terraform uses **providers** to manage different infrastructure components.  
- Many providers are available for **clouds, databases, networking, and security**.

## **Terraform Architecture**
Terraform consists of several key components:
- **Terraform Core**: Manages state, plans changes, and applies updates.
- **Providers**: Plugins that allow Terraform to manage infrastructure resources.
- **Modules**: Reusable infrastructure components.
- **State File**: Stores metadata and resource information.

---

## **Terraform Use Cases**
- **Cloud Infrastructure Management**: Automate provisioning and scaling of cloud resources.
- **Multi-Cloud Deployments**: Manage resources across AWS, Azure, and GCP simultaneously.
- **Infrastructure Automation**: Use CI/CD pipelines to deploy infrastructure automatically.
- **Configuration as Code**: Define network, storage, and compute resources in a structured format.
- **Disaster Recovery**: Quickly recreate infrastructure in case of failures.

## **Why Use Terraform?**  
âœ… **Consistent** infrastructure management  
âœ… **Version control** for infrastructure changes  
âœ… **Scalable** for large environments  
âœ… **Supports hybrid & multi-cloud environments**  
âœ… **Improves team collaboration** with shared state
